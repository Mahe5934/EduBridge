# EduBridge - Remote Classes for Rural Colleges
## Project Implementation Todo List

### Project Overview
This document outlines the implementation plan for EduBridge, a lightweight remote learning system designed for rural colleges with limited infrastructure. The system uses Python's built-in `http.server` for the backend and HTML/CSS/JS for the frontend.

### Timeline: 3 Months

  - Implement security measures to prevent unauthorized file access
  - Test server functionality with simple requests

### Week 2: Frontend Foundation
- [ ] Create basic frontend HTML/CSS/JS pages
  - Design homepage with project overview
  - Create navigation structure (header/footer)
  - Implement responsive design for various device sizes
  - Add modern styling with CSS
  - Ensure low-bandwidth optimization
  - Test pages on different devices/browsers

### Week 3: Core Endpoints
- [ ] Implement endpoints for lectures, notes, and quizzes
  - Create API endpoints for content delivery
  - Design JSON structure for content metadata
  - Implement content retrieval functionality
  - Add search/filter capabilities for content
  - Test all endpoints with sample data
  - Document API endpoints

### Week 4: Content Structure
- [ ] Design course page with lecture lists
  - Create course listing page

## Additional Considerations

### Technical Requirements
- Lightweight implementation with minimal dependencies
- Optimized for low-bandwidth rural internet connections
- Scalable content management system
- Secure file handling and access control
- Simple maintenance and update procedures

### Success Metrics
- Number of students accessing lectures
- Number of courses/content uploaded
- Usage frequency (daily/weekly access)
- Student feedback on content accessibility
- Teacher participation rate

### Risk Mitigation
- Limited Features: Plan for future upgrade to FastAPI/Django if needed
- Internet Issues: Ensure robust offline functionality
- Device Shortage: Utilize community computer labs
- Training Gaps: Develop comprehensive training materials and conduct orientation sessions
