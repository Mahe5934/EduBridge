## 7. Architecture

### System Architecture
EduBridge follows a client-server architecture with a clear separation between frontend and backend components:

```
┌─────────┐    HTTP/JSON    ┌──────────────────┐
│   Frontend      │◄───────────────►│    Backend       │
│  (HTML/CSS/JS)  │                 │ (Python http.server)│
└─────────────────┘                 └──────────────────┘
                                              │
                                    ┌─────────┴─────────┐
                                    │                   │
                          ┌─────────▼─────────┐ ┌───────▼────────┐
                          │   Data Storage    │ │ Authentication │
                          │   (JSON Files)    │ │   (Planned)    │
                          └───────────────────┘ └────────────────┘
```

### Backend Components
- **Main Server**: `server.py` - Handles HTTP requests and serves static files
- **API Handler**: `api.py` - Manages RESTful endpoints for courses, lectures, notes, and quizzes
- **Data Models**: `models.py` - Defines data structures for educational content
- **Utilities**: `utils.py` - Helper functions for data handling and ID generation
- **Data Storage**: JSON files in `backend/data/` directory

### Frontend Components
- **HTML Pages**: Eight main pages providing different functionality
- **CSS Styling**: `style.css` for responsive design and visual presentation
- **JavaScript Logic**: `main.js` for interactive features and API communication
- **Static Assets**: Images and other media files

### Data Flow
1. User interacts with frontend interface
2. JavaScript sends HTTP requests to backend API endpoints
3. Backend processes requests and accesses data from JSON files
4. Backend returns JSON responses to frontend
5. JavaScript updates UI based on API responses

### Security Considerations
- Input sanitization to prevent injection attacks
- File path validation to prevent unauthorized file access
- CORS headers for controlled cross-origin requests
- Future authentication system planned for user management
