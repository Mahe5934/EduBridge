# EduBridge Frontend

This directory contains the frontend implementation for the EduBridge project, a lightweight remote learning system designed for rural colleges with limited infrastructure.

## Project Overview

EduBridge is a comprehensive digital learning platform that bridges the educational gap between urban educational resources and rural college students. Our mission is to ensure that geographic location doesn't determine the quality of education a student receives. The platform connects rural college students with expert teachers and high-quality educational content through a lightweight, accessible system designed specifically for low-bandwidth environments.

## Key Features

### Core Functionality
- **Course Catalog**: Browse and search through a comprehensive catalog of courses across multiple disciplines
- **Lecture Access**: View lecture materials with downloadable content for offline viewing
- **Interactive Notes**: Access detailed course notes with code examples and diagrams
- **Assessment Tools**: Take quizzes to test knowledge and track progress
- **Search Functionality**: Find specific content across all courses and materials

### Technical Features
- **Responsive Design**: Fully functional on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
- **Lightweight Architecture**: Optimized for low-bandwidth rural internet connections
- **Accessibility**: Clean, simple interface suitable for first-time digital learners
- **Offline Capability**: Download content for offline viewing when internet is unavailable
- **Multi-language Support**: Content available in local languages for better accessibility

3. **Cache Strategies**: Content caching for improved performance on repeat visits

## How to Run

### Local Development
1. Simply open any of the HTML files in a web browser
2. No build process or server required
3. All pages are statically linked and work independently
4. For enhanced development experience, use Live Server extension in VS Code

### Production Deployment
1. Upload all files to any web hosting service
2. No server-side requirements
3. Works with any static hosting provider (GitHub Pages, Netlify, etc.)

## Browser Support

The frontend is designed to work on all modern browsers including:
- Chrome (latest versions)
- Firefox (latest versions)
- Safari (latest versions)
- Edge (latest versions)
- Mobile browsers (iOS Safari, Android Chrome)

The platform also maintains reasonable functionality on older browsers through progressive enhancement.

## Development Guidelines
